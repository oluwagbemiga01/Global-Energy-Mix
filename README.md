# Global Energy Dashboard Project

### üìä A Data Story on Fossil Fuels, Renewables, and the Energy Transition

---

## Objective
This project explores global energy consumption patterns, right from fossil fuels to low carbon sources to answer to key questions around sustainability, transition, and global energy dependency.

The goal: **Help stakeholders and the public better understand who consumes: what, where, and how the world is shifting toward cleaner energy**.
